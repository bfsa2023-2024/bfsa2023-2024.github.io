      <p>In the Philippines, the curriculum frameworks of individual states vary. Students begin studying science in lower elementary school in an observational way. Science in elementary school covers basic concepts of life sciences, physical sciences, and Earth and space sciences that develop across the grades. In middle school, students study science in more depth; 	science courses are still integrated into most cities and districts, but the focus on specific content areas may differ across the grades (e.g., a focus on Earth and space sciences in Grade 6, life sciences in Grade 7, and physical sciences in Grade 8). A focus on investigation and experimentation starts in elementary school and increases in sophistication in the middle school grades.</p>

	<li>Understanding that some characteristics of organisms are inherited from the parents, and some are the result of interactions with the environment; examples of inherited versus 	acquired/learned traits</li>
	<li>How physical features and behaviors help living things survive in their environments; understanding that when the environment changes, some organisms survive, while others die or 	move to a different location</li>
	<li>Relationships in communities and ecosystems (e.g., simple food chains, predator-prey relationships); the role of the Sun, plants, and animals in the transfer of energy in 	ecosystems; effects of changes in ecosystems (e.g., overpopulation, lack of food sources)**</li>

	<li>Classifying materials based on physical properties (e.g., weight/mass, volume, color, texture, conducting heat, conducting electricity, magnetic attraction)</li>
	<li>Mixtures and how to separate a mixture into its components (e.g., sifting, filtering, evaporation, using a magnet)**</li>
	<li>Chemical changes in everyday life (e.g., decaying, burning, rusting, cooking); knowledge that combining substances may result in new materials with different properties**</li>
	<li>Types and observations of energy (heat, sound, light, electrical, mechanical/motion); common sources of energy (e.g., the Sun, electricity, wind); and uses of energy (heating and 	cooling homes, providing light)</li>
	<li>Energy transformations (e.g., electrical energy converted to motion, sound, heat, or light; mechanical energy converted to heat energy or electrical energy)</li>
	<li>Basic properties and behavior of light (light travels in a straight line until it strikes an object or travels from one medium to another; light can be reflected, refracted, or 	absorbed; objects that block light produce shadows)**</li>
	<li>Basic properties of sound (sound is produced by vibrating objects, and the pitch changes with the rate of vibration)**</li>
	<li>Electricity and simple circuits (e.g., identifying materials that are conductors); knowing that the flow of electricity requires a closed circuit (complete loop); constructing 	simple circuits using wires, batteries, and bulbs; demonstrating that electric circuits can produce heat, light, sound, and motion</li>
	<li>Properties of magnets (e.g., knowing that like poles repel and opposite poles attract, recognizing that magnets can attract some objects); uses of electromagnets**</li>
	<li>Forces that cause objects to move (e.g., gravity, pushing/pulling, magnetic force); the effect of friction on motion**</li>
